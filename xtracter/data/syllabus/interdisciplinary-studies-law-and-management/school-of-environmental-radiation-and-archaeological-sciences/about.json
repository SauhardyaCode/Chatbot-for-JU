    "description": "A brief statement of the aims and purposes of the School:\n\nC14 dating is regarded as one of the most ingenious methods of nuclear process application. Its importance goes far beyond the dating of archaeological remains or fossils. The improved counting techniques enable us to quantitatively establish the amount of similar weakly beta-active nuclei present in the earth and its environment such as Kr85 and Ar37. Each of these reveals interesting aspects of the ral or man-made processes in whih they are inherent."
