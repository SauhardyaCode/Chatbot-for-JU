    "name": "Life science & Bio-technology",
    "description": "The department of Life Science and Biotechnology was established in the year 1985. Since its inception, the department has thrived to flourish in various interdisciplinary and vast areas of Life Science. Till now the department has produced a steady flow of high-quality students and scholars who excelled in their careers later.  The major strength of the department is its location which is within the close physical proximity of a number of nationally famous Institutes and Research laboratories. Although this opens up the possibility of establishing collaborative research and exchange academic programs with other institutions, the department is the only department in the University, which pursues its academic programme in the area of fundamental and basic life science research.  Consequently, the scope of in-house collaborative research and complementation of academic activities with other departments is relatively less. In addition, the financial and other support of the host institution to the department is not adequate. Therefore, the major current challenge for the department is to expand vigorously within the available limited support systems of the University"
