    "name": "Film Studies",
    "description": "The Department of Film Studies at Jadavpur University, established in 1993, was the first of its kind in India. In a way this is a fair reflection of the strong film culture in this city. Satyajit Ray proposed the study of cinema as an academic subject when, in 1980, he visited the University to accept an honorary D.Lit. Jadavpur University has an enormous support base for a discipline like Film Studies. It has a considerable fund of expertise in the three faculties of Arts, Science and Engineering, and a very good infrastructural base. The strong cultural and intellectual tradition of Calcutta has also been of considerable importance in providing the right kind of atmosphere for the study of a frontier discipline."
