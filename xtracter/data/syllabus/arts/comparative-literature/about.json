    "description": "Reading the World: The Department of Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University (JUCL) is the oldest department of Comparative Literature in India. It was founded by Buddhadeva Bose in 1956. Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University provides the opportunity to read literary works originally composed in many different languages from different parts of the world. It also goes beyond the study of only ‘literature’ to include the study of various arts, media and cultures. The ultimate objective is to go beyond the study of isolated texts and traditions to understand the holistic narrative of world literature characterized by dynamic transactions between languages, writers, texts and traditions."
